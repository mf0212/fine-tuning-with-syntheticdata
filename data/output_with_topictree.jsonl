Here's a simple example using a linear trend and a known seasonality period. Let's assume a daily frequency with a seasonality period of 7 days:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import signal\n\n# Assuming 'time_series' is a numpy array containing your time series data.\n\n# Trend extraction (using a linear fit)\ndef extract_trend(signal):\n x = np.arange(len(signal))\n fit = np.polyfit(x, signal, deg=1)\n trend = np.polyval(fit, x)\n return trend\n\ntrend = extract_trend(time_series)\n\n# Detrend the time series\ndetrended = time_series - trend\n\n# Extract seasonality (using a simple mean over the period)\ndef extract_seasonality(detrended, period=7):\n return np.array([np.mean(detrended[i::period]) for i in range(period)])\n\nseasonality = extract_seasonality(detrended)\n\n# Reshape seasonality for broadcasting\nseasonality = np.tile(seasonality, int(np.ceil(len(detrended) / period)))[:len(detrended)]\n\n# Remainder is what's left after extracting trend and seasonality\nremainder = detrended - seasonality\n\nprint('Trend:', trend)\nprint('Seasonality:', seasonality)\nprint('Remainder:', remainder)\n```\n\nNote that this is a very simplistic approach. For a more sophisticated decomposition, you might want to look into statistical libraries such as `statsmodels` which offers a `seasonal_decompose` method that can handle both additive and multiplicative decomposition models."}]}
